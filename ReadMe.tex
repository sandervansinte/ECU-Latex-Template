%% Instructions %%

% Before startting make sure to edit the metadata.tex file (1.Metadata/metadata.tex) and setup.tex file (1.Metadata/setup.tex) according to your specific requirements.

% Customize the packages you want to use in the packages.tex file (1.Metadata/packages.tex).

% Make sure to compile all your acronyms and definitions in the acronyms-definitions.tex file (1.Metadata/acronyms-definitions.tex) if you intend to use the glossary functionality. If you do not intend to use the glossary functionality, you can simply leave the acronyms-definitions.tex file empty.  

% The template is structured in a way that the main content of your research proposal should be included in the Mainmatter folder (3.Mainmatter/). You can create as many files as you need for the different sections and include them in the main.tex file.

% The Figures folder (6.Figures/) is meant to store all your figures. You can set the path for the figures in the setup.tex file (1.Metadata/setup.tex).
